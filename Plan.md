8Perfect timing, Martin — this **ICP Bitcoin DeFi Hackathon** is *exactly* the kind of event that can help you showcase your growing blockchain + Web3 skills while building something that has real-world potential.

Let’s design a **clear, 4-week roadmap and idea plan** for you 👇

---

## 🎯 **Hackathon Overview**

**Theme:** “Unleashing the next era of BTCFi on the Internet Computer (ICP)”
**Duration:** Oct 27 – Nov 24, 2025
**Goal:** Build DeFi apps that use **ICP’s native Bitcoin integration** — *no bridges, no wrapped BTC, no custodians.*

You can:

* Use **ckBTC** for lightning-fast BTC transactions.
* Interact with Bitcoin directly from **ICP canisters**.
* Build DeFi tools like lending, swaps, payments, or automation using **threshold ECDSA/Schnorr**.

---

## 💡 **Project Ideas You Could Build**

Here are **5 strong, buildable ideas** tailored for a solo or small team dev setup (you can later expand if you find teammates):

---

### 🧠 **1. BTC Savings Vault (Dead Man Switch)**

**Concept:**
A smart Bitcoin vault built on ICP where users deposit BTC and set a “backup recipient.”
If the user doesn’t log in for a set time, the funds auto-transfer.

**Features:**

* ckBTC integration for deposits/withdrawals
* Timer-based smart contract
* Threshold ECDSA for secure signing
* Optional encrypted “note to heir” using vetKeys

**Why it stands out:**
Combines *DeFi + inheritance + privacy*. Great storytelling angle.

---

### 💸 **2. Cross-chain BTC–SOL Swap Hub**

**Concept:**
A decentralized swapping DApp that allows BTC ↔ SOL swaps **without wrapped assets or custodians**, using ICP as the transaction coordinator.

**Features:**

* Use **ICP SOL RPC Canister**
* BTC on ICP + SOL via canister bridge
* Threshold Schnorr for secure atomic swaps
* Simple React interface for swaps

**Why it’s powerful:**
First practical example of ICP coordinating cross-chain swaps.

---

### 🏦 **3. Bitcoin Microloan DApp (Runes Collateral)**

**Concept:**
Users lock their Ordinals/Runes as collateral and borrow ckBTC instantly.
If they don’t repay in time, the collateral auto-liquidates.

**Features:**

* ICP Canister to store Runes metadata
* Smart contract lending rules
* Dynamic ckBTC pricing using BTCDeFi.dev API

**Why it’s strong:**
DeFi + NFTs (Ordinals) = creative use case.

---

### 🧾 **4. Bitcoin Payment Gateway for Businesses**

**Concept:**
A plug-and-play API for Kenyan or global merchants to accept BTC payments instantly via ICP’s ckBTC.

**Features:**

* ckBTC payment button generator
* Instant confirmation using ICP Bitcoin API
* Merchant dashboard
* Optional fiat value converter

**Why it’s great:**
Real-world use case. Could expand into an actual startup later.

---

### 🔐 **5. Secure Bitcoin Password Vault (vetKeys)**

**Concept:**
An encrypted password & seed storage vault built using **vetKeys**.
Decrypt access only with threshold keys + biometric hash (future-ready).

**Features:**

* vetKeys integration for secret sharing
* Multi-user recovery keys
* Secure encrypted notes

**Why it’s unique:**
Blends cryptography + privacy + real-world security.

## 🧩 **How to Pick (Based on You)**

Since you’ve built Web3 and payment-related ideas before (e.g., SmartLearnChain & Safari Tales Scales), I recommend:
👉 **Option 1: BTC Savings Vault (Dead Man Switch)**

It’s:

* Simple to explain.
* Possible to build solo using Rust/Motoko templates.
* Emotionally appealing and memorable.
* Uses **ckBTC + Threshold ECDSA + vetKeys**.
